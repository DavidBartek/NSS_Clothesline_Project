# NSS_Clothesline_Project
Contains the final "Clothesline" program (and word banks) from the NSS Software Engineering Jumpstart.

Made by David Bartek with much guidance from Matt Krueger during the January 2023 NSS Software Engineering Jumpstart

IMPORTANT: When running program, specify the desired word list .txt file in the command line. For example: python3 clothesline.py fruits.txt

Enjoy!
